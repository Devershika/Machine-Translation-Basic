# Machine-Translation-Basic
Machine Translation (MT) refers to the use of computational models and algorithms to automatically translate text or speech from one language to another. It is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has evolved from rule-based systems to statistical approaches and now to neural machine translation (NMT) powered by deep learning.

## Types of Machine Translation Approaches
1. Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT)

* Relies on linguistic rules (syntax, morphology, grammar).
* Uses bilingual dictionaries and hand-crafted rules.
* Example: Early MT systems like SYSTRAN.
* Advantage: Transparent and explainable translations.
* Limitation: Requires extensive linguistic resources; lacks scalability.
